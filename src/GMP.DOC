                       GMP - the Graphical Module Player

                           (C) 1992 Jussi Lahdenniemi
                             and Otto Chrons (DSMI)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------


                Like DMP earlier, GMP is not just a module player but a public
        'beta-test' version of the DSMI. DMP is written in C, GMP in Pascal.
        The DSMI is not yet available in C nor in Pascal. Please test this
        program with all your modules and report any bugs you can find to the
        author(s).


                                     USAGE
                                     =====

                Using GMP is quite straightforward. By running it without any
        commandline parameters, it will give you a brief description of the
        parameters available. The format is:

        GMP <Modulename> [-sxx] [-o] [-l] [-dx] [-z]

        Where
        <Modulename> specifies the module(s) you want to play. Wildcards are
                     allowed.
        -sxxxx       specifies the sampling rate. Default is 16kHz. You can
                     specify the sampling rate in Hzs or kHzs (4000-22000 or
                     4-22).
        -o           play modules in random order (just like DMP's -o)
        -l           do not loop modules
        -dx          how the bars are drawn in the playing screen. X can be
                     zero or one. You can change this setting during the
                     playing by pressing B.
        -z           remove instrument names from the bars. This is recommended
                     for slower machines ( < 386/25 maybe). You can toggle this
                     also in the playing screen with Z.

        After you have succesfully executed the GMP, it displays some info on
        the screen and then loads the first module and starts playing. After
        you have recovered from your amazement ( :) ), try pressing H to get
        the help screen. You can scroll the help screen with the up- and down-
        arrows. Try everyting..

                        COMMENTS ABOUT PROGRAMMING DSMI
                        ===============================

                Never would I have believed that programming a module player is
        this easy! A fully working module player can be written with only about
        twenty lines of Pascal. And, having so many features, GMP's source code
        is only about 900 lines! So, after DSMI will be released, purchase it!
                It was quite an interesting and challenging job to convert the
        DSMI from C to Pascal. I had to cheat the Pascal compiler all the time
        - never turn range checking on while programming with DSMI ;).. Anyway,
        I was able to convert all the programs (with some help from Otto). So,
        when the DSMI will be released, you will be able to purchase both the C
        and the Pascal versions.
