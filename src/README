              New features in DSMI (not in the document) :
              --------------------------------------------


 - SDIs for Aria and Windows Sound System. These SDIs are used just like
   the other SDIs.

 - Module loaders for *.669 and *.S3M. These modules are loaded just like
   MODs, STMs and AMFs.

 - PC speaker support for the DAC SDI. Use the port address $42 to play
   with the PC speaker.

 - The EMS heap manager. With this unit (EMHM.TP*) you can use EMS in your
   program. The functions are quite self-explanary and they can be found from
   the file EMHM.PAS in SOURCE subdirectory. Allocate EMS with allocEMS, then
   call lockEMS with the handle, and you get an address for the piece of
   memory in the EMS page frame.

 - Now also all the ASM sources are included, except the mcplayer. If you
   want to recompile these, define the l_pascal symbol (run TASM like this:
   TASM /dl_pascal *.asm).
   Also, if you are using the 3.2 version of Tasm (comes with the BP7.0),
   use the switch /ut310, to use the tasm 3.10 compatible mode.
